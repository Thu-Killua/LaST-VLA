## 📖 Abstract

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have revolutionized autonomous driving by unifying perception and planning, their reliance on explicit textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) leads to semantic-perceptual decoupling and perceptual-symbolic conflicts. Recent shifts toward latent reasoning attempt to bypass these bottlenecks by thinking in continuous hidden space. However, without explicit intermediate constraints, standard latent CoT often operates as a physics-agnostic representation. To address this, we propose the Latent Spatio-Temporal VLA (LaST-VLA), a framework shifting the reasoning paradigm from discrete symbolic processing into a physically grounded Latent Spatio-Temporal CoT. By implementing a dual-feature alignment mechanism, we distill geometric constraints from 3D foundation models and dynamic foresight from world models directly into the latent space. Coupled with a progressive SFT training strategy that transitions from feature alignment to trajectory generation, and refined via Reinforcement Learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to ensure safety and rule compliance. LaST-VLA setting a new record on NAVSIM v1 (91.3 PDMS) and NAVSIM v2 (87.1 EPDMS), while excelling in spatial-temporal reasoning on SURDS and NuDynamics benchmarks.

    <p><strong>Overview of the framework.</strong> <strong>(a) Model Architecture:</strong> The model constructs a Latent CoT by aligning hidden states with dynamic and geometric priors distilled from foundation models (Cosmos and VGGT) via specialized adapters. <strong>(b) Progressive Training Strategy:</strong> The pipeline features a two-stage SFT phase that utilizes structured causal masking to enforce physically grounded reasoning, followed by RL fine-tuning to directly optimize the policy for driving safety and compliance.</p>
